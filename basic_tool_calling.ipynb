Exercises\n","\n","1. **Add a unit conversion tool.** Write a function `convert_units(value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str)` that converts between units (e.g. Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit, kilometres ↔ miles). Update the router to detect phrases like \"convert 10 miles to kilometres\" and call this new tool.\n","2. **Improve routing.** Enhance `route_query` to recognise synonyms (e.g. \"sum\" instead of \"plus\", \"forecast\" instead of \"weather\") and to extract multi-word city names (e.g. \"New York\").\n","3. **Handle invalid queries gracefully.** Modify the router so that it returns a helpful error message when the expression is malformed or the city is unknown, rather than silently failing.\n","4. **Nested tool calls.** Think about how you would support questions that require chaining tools, such as \"What is the square of the temperature in Paris?\". Sketch out a plan for the planning and execution steps.\n","\n","\n","3. **Add a weather tool.** Define a simple `weather_service(location)` function that returns hard‑coded weather information for a few cities. Extend the router to detect questions about the weather.\n","4. **Improve routing.** Replace the keyword matching with a regular expression or small classifier to better detect arithmetic phrases.\n","5. **Nested tools.** Imagine a query like 'What is the average of 3 and 5?'. Compose a small pipeline that first uses the calculator to add the numbers, then divides by two.
